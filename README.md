Notes
----
* You can develop the UI independently of the backend.
  * This means you don't have to set up the entire stack (databases, etc.), or worry about getting starter data.
  * By default, the UI points to the production API.
  * You can configure it to point to your own backend (if you are working on a new feature and want to start building the UI before it's deployed to production).
* You can configure the port used by webpack-dev-server in `webpack.config.js`.

  * Strongly recommended for active developers! We move fast and it's helpful to be up to speed with everything that's happening.
